Hi I am Aditya . Currently learning python. Interested in AI and Cybersecurity. Building Beginner projects to strengthen my skills 😀🌟.  #doingforpassion🤩🔥⚡
I have done a project😀 which is on a general knowledge quiz named VioletDistantNet.zip. 
Just done my second project which basically calculates your personal expenses and is named starting by trinket . Hope you find it convenient and helpful while calculating.
The passion is firing up 💪 🔥⚡.
Did my third project which is just related to Bio which tells you where you have deficiency of nutrients or not. Did this project because I have interest in Bio also . Hope you find it convenient 😁.
Did my 4th project which calculates BMI and classifies students into different types of weight categories and this project is done using NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib . Hope you like it 😁. 
5th project - Weather Analyzer. Check description for details 
6th project - Diabetes Prediction . Check description for details 
7th project - 🔐 Password Strength Checker

A Python-based project that evaluates the strength and security of passwords. It provides instant feedback by analyzing password length, character diversity, entropy, and whether the password belongs to a list of weak/common passwords.


---

✨ Features

✅ Checks length of the password

✅ Verifies character diversity (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols)

✅ Estimates entropy (difficulty to guess)

✅ Detects weak/common passwords

✅ Provides instant feedback: Weak / Moderate / Strong



---

💡 Why This Project?

With rising cases of cyberattacks due to weak credentials, password security is more important than ever. This project is a hands-on demonstration of applying Python for a real-world cybersecurity problem.
